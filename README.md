# 👗 **DressUp — Your Personalized Fashion Shopping Experience**

DressUp is a modern, elegant, and feature‑rich clothing e‑commerce web application built using **ASP.NET MVC**, **C#**, **Entity Framework**, and **SQL Server**. This project stands out for its **clean architecture**, **real-world functionalities**, and **professional UI/UX** that mirrors industry-level online fashion stores.

## 🚀 **Why DressUp Stands Out**

### 🌟 **1. Real E‑Commerce Functionality (End‑to‑End)**

DressUp replicates the full workflow of a professional shopping platform — from browsing products to managing cart, wishlist,  sorting, and secure checkout flow.

### 🛒 **2. Interactive & Dynamic User Experience**

* Seamless cart & wishlist management
* Real-time updates using Fetch APIs
* Smooth transitions without page reloads
* Persistent user experience

### 🔍 **3. Advanced sorting & Search System**

* Search by title & type
* Sort by price (low→high / high→low)
* Responsive gallery UI with loader animations

### 🎨 **4. Clean, Modern, Responsive UI**

The UI is built to look premium:

* Minimalistic card design
* Clean typography
* Responsive grid layout
* Animated buttons & icons

### 🛡️ **5. Scalable & Industry‑Standard Code Structure**

* Layered architecture: Controllers → Services → Repositories → Database
* DTO-based data handling
* Model validations
* Secure authentication (JWT + OTP supported)
* Follows SOLID principles

### 🧱 **6. Perfect Project to Impress Recruiters**

This project highlights your skills in:

* Full-stack .NET development
* REST APIs
* Real-world database design
* Frontend + backend integration
* Problem-solving & system thinking
* End‑to‑end product building

Recruiters love seeing **complete, polished projects**—DressUp delivers that.
